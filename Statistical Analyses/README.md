# Code Functionality
This code was originally worked on by Taz Saad and Aziz Zafar, and then cleaned, compiled, and edited to more modular by Thanh Dang. 
Below are some functions that perform different statistical tests, including: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Mediation Analysis, Association Rule Learning, and ANOVA. Contact @thdang@colgate.edu for any queries or follow-up questions.

The code has 8 separate chunks to perform different statistical analysis. Navigate yourself to the specific methods desired and follow the function description. 

# Add Input File
It is very important that the data is processed, imputed, and balanced--tailored to the goal of the statistical analysis. 
Attention should be paid to the data type (continuous/categorical); else the code will crash.

# Results
Results will be stored in the respective directory named by the statistical analysis method. The code automatically checks existing paths and create respective folders; you can change the name of files/directories as desired by modifying the code.
